# Curation Station
Web app and recommendation engine that will create a spotify playlist from a growing RDS database of independent/DIY artists.

The goal is to allow people to find new music that is similar to popular songs around the same set of distinct audio features which seperate subgenres from each other. This idea started out as a simple way for myself to discover new music on Spotify (outside of their annoy recommender), by using a database of artists I made from scraping my favorite indepdendent music blogs. That was very early in my understanding of machine learning, and am working to expand this idea beyond its simple beginnings.

**The Future**:
-Complete exploration (see "birthday is a music genre" repo) and clustering of genres for training the model

-Clean and update the independent artists dataset for deployment of database server

-Begin designing and building the front end

-Deploy a soft release (or "alpha") version
