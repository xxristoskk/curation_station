# curation_station
Recommendation engine that creates (or appends) a spotify playlist from a growing RDS database of independent/DIY artists.

The goal is to allow people to find new music that is similar to popular artists around the same genre neighborhood.

Although this is a work in progress, the sample json file still works with the functions.py and curation_station.py scripts.

Coming soon:

Frontend gui for collaborative filtering. This will allow anyone to easily log in with their Spotify account and start making playlists.

Dashboard and jupyter notebook outlining the process of this project.
