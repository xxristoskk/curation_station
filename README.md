# curation_station
Creates (or appends) a spotify playlist from a growing database of lesser known artists.

The goal is to allow people to find new music that is similar to a popular artist or genre they already enjoy.

Although this is still a work in progress, the sample json file still works with the scripts.

Coming soon:

Frontend dashboard
Ability to narrow search with multiple genres
Specify a location of an artist (to find local talent)
